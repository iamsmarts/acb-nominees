    name: "Angel Figueroa",
    aboutYourself: `Name is Angel David Figueroa (for those who don’t know my middle name ha). I’ve been supporting the LA Galaxy since opening day in ‘96 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and continue supporting the club both home and away. You can find me in ACB (sections 121/122) at DHSP, in the away end on the road, at viewing parties across SoCal, and/or Monday nights live on YouTube on - the world famous - Straight From The Stands podcast.`,
    previousExperience: `My duties were heavily  focused (and continue to be) on away travel, viewing parties set up, tailgate coordination, and liaising (somewhat of an ACB ambassador) between the other supporter groups who support the LA Galaxy; although, I do take on ad hoc responsibilities/duties.`,
    whyYou: [
      `Since joining ACB leadership, I firmly believe that I’ve been one of the catalysts in creating this togetherness-feel between the LA Galaxy fan base and have been essential in helping cultivate a sense of family that goes beyond the independent/respective SG’s. With this in mind, I know that I’ll be an excellent choice for ACB leadership because my work isn’t finished and I’m eager on finishing what I’ve started! With Victoria Block coming in 2020 and already having been heavily involved in uniting the various groups supporting our LA Galaxy (whether with focus on VB or away games), I know I can continue contributing building on the foundation we’ve helped create over the last 2-3 years with my time, knowledge, personality, and passion.`

    name: `Brian Zuniga`,
    aboutYourself: `I was raised in the community of Wilmington in the Harbor Area of L.A. to Mexican parents. Like most folks w/ a Latinx background I was introduced to soccer at an early age. I began following the Galaxy in High School around the time the stadium was built and instantly became obsessed w/ the team. Although I may have other interests such as the outdoors, cooking, fitness and occasionally revisiting my Punk Rock past, everything in my life revolves around this team and group.`,
    previousExperience: null,
    whyYou: [
      `My experience working w/ ACB would make me a good fit as a board member. I’ve been involved w/ the group practically since it was founded. Helping in anyway that I could. Game day OPS, creating songs/chants, helping from beginning to end with TIFO, etc.
        Being around the group for so long I’ve seen firsthand what works well for the group and what does not.`

    name: "Evelyn Silva",
    aboutYourself: `My name is Evelyn and I was born and raised in L.A. (well technically in the SGV). Grew up in a family composed of primary boys 3 brothers, dad, and mum. Growing up soccer was always a big part of my family. Brothers played soccer all their lives, dad played and coached soccer leagues himself. Even though I myself never played I always had a passion for it. My first memory of watching futbol always involved the Mexican league (Liga MX). Being Mexican American and roots from Guadalajara Jalisco it was obvious our family team would be the Chivas de Guadalajara. It was easy for me to start following the sport cause I grew up around it, but understanding the passion behind it was another different story. I became interested in the MLS league in 2011 (also the year we won a cup). My brother's and my dad started going to LA Galaxy games and I would go with them. Little did I know that this was gonna be one of the best experiences of my life. That year the Galaxy won ANOTHER MLS Cup and I was beyond ecstatic at the fact that the team I started to follow was now winning a cup!!! The more I watched the team thrive the more my passion grew for the team. The following year (2012) I was introduced to ACB a supporter group that would chant and cheer for a team that I was already in love with. Never in this GALAXY did I ever think that a soccer team and supporter group would end up being full of people that I now call FAMILY!!! Here I am 8 years later still supporting the team, still cheering 90+ minutes, still traveling miles for this team, and still learning with every season the passion of what it is to be a supporter for this team. Cause win or lose we are L.A. TILL WE DIE!!!`,
    previousExperience: null,
    whyYou: [
      `In the years that I have been in ACB there have been great leaders on the board. Every year that goes on demonstrates the hard work and dedication each and every individual on the board has for not only the team but for the supporter group. I feel that I would be able to contribute to ACB by bringing not only ideas but also insight on what our members( that are not on the board) want and need.`

        Born and raised in Watts, I've been attending Galaxy games for as long as I remember. I've been an active member of the group since 2013. Most of my time outside of work has been going to games and hanging out with people I've met in the  stands.`,

I've done my share of travelling for the team. I'm fairly knowledgeable with general information that I've passed on to other members that have questions.`,
      `Being on the board would be my next step in helping ACB as a whole group and want to continue the work that has already been laid out by current and past board members.`

    aboutYourself: `I am a mother and wife, and my day job consists of operations management at a busy surgical center in South Bay. I was raised in Compton, grew up loving sports and rooting for LA teams. My family and I came to our first Galaxy game in 2010, and joined ACB in 2011. The rest is history. I completely fell in love with the ambience, the energy, the passion and how welcoming ACB was to me and my family. My love continues to grow-- I eat, sleep and breathe the G's and ACB. `,
    previousExperience: `Board of directors since 2015, President of ACB since 2018. I have worked on every bit of every piece of the group. My biggest pride has been our charity drives. I like to help our local community, especially those that lack morale and support.`,
    whyYou: [
      "Over the past five years, I have proven to pour my entire heart into ACB.",
      "I am comfortable helping and handling all areas and committees.",
      `I have been a huge advocate for a system of merit and accountability-- from our officers, to our board to our members, to our front office supporter contacts, to security teams, etc. I want to encourage everyone to be devoted to this group, game days or not, in and out of the stands. I'm diplomatic and fair. I can take initiative while maintaining open communication and inclusivity with all decisions made. The current board as a whole has created ways to engage new members, to be welcoming, and to give them reasons to come back for more. I am always open to ideas to better that tailgate/game-day experience, as well as plan non-game day opportunities for interaction like picnics, holiday parties for all, etc. I have implemented business management standards that have shown growth of the group, have driven our financial growth by about 500%, which all goes back to ur group and members.`,
      "I have proven to be a good leader and I plan to do the same for the upcoming years."
